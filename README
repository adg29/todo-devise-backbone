Task:

Create a very simple, web based, to-do application. This would be
something that could substitute using a sticky and pen. The time limit is
four hours.

Required Stories:
- As a user, I should be able to create an account with just my email
address (no password required)
- As a user, I should be able to add a todo that includes title
(required), description (optional) and due date (optional)
- As a user, I should be able to reorder todos easily
- As a user, I can checkoff todos
- As a user, I can login using just my email address
- As a user, I don¹t have to login unless I¹ve cleared my cache

Nice to have stories (in order):
- As a user, I can add and manage todos 100% through AJAX
- As a user, I get reminded by email when a todo is past due
- As a user, I can create nested todos

Based on:
Example rails application used in Railscasts.
Example backone.js application ToDos.

___________________________________________________________________-


When reading the code, please keep the following in mind:

There are some naming conventions 
established by the projects on which this application is based
that remain to be refactored so that the application code make sense. 

For example, 
the projects model should be renamed to todo.

KNOWN BUGS:

The projects controller action 'create' is returning a 500 error when it is being called
by backbone´s sync method because of extra parameters that rails includes, which are causing
an unknown attribute error. The problem is very similar to the one described here
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7137096/error-when-saving-a-backbone-js-model-with-rails

The above issue is a block on the following issues:

The todos created are not currently tied to any particular logged in user.
